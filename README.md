A Python-based benefit configuration engine that models healthcare plan creation, including deductible, copay, and multi-service coverage validation. Implements rule-based validation logic to detect configuration errors and enforce business constraints â€” simulating the technical responsibilities of a Product Modeler in a healthcare system like NASCO. Designed to reflect real-world benefit product implementation workflows such as structured plan setup, logic consistency checks, and QA readiness.
